### Lab 1 File Instructions
1. lab1-s25.pdf: instructions about lab 1 <br>
2. report_lab1: screen snapshots and documents that record my lab results <br>
3. data folder and scripts folder include parsed data and scripts as instructed. <br>
    1. In the scripts folder, I include three versions of web-scrapping. In web_scraper_requests.py, I used requests library to get website. Since it does not work with the dynamic market data, I use selenium library in other scripts. However, since I constantly fail to use selenium library to connect to the web, I eventually use web_scraper_requests.py to do web-scrapping and serve for the subsequent data filtering. Therefore, all the raw data and processed data are based on the web_scraper_requests.py. While selenium library does not function due to certain environment setup, I still incorporate these my scripts to do web-scrapping through selenium library on both Firefox (i.e., web_scraper_firefox.py) and Chrome (i.e., web_scraper_chrome.py).
